Description
-----------
Mythicimals is a pet simulator game intended for audiences 7 years old and up. It attempts to emulate the experiences of older, similar games, such as Tamagotchi. The player is tasked with caring for a virtual pet friend by feeding it, giving it gifts, and playing with it. The end goal is to teach children the skills needed to care for a real-life animal in a way that is very fantastical, approachable and fun.

Required Libraries
------------------
For our project, we used Visual Studio Code to compile and build our project. javac may be sufficient, but it is not what we used. 
To download Visual Studio Code, either download it directly from the Microsoft Store or from https://code.visualstudio.com/.

To run the JUnit tests, you need junit-4.13.2.jar and hamcrest-core-1.3.jar in the 'lib' folder inside of the group41 folder. To gain these things, we used the Extension Pack for Java available on VSCode from Microsoft. To download these extensions, go to the Extensions tab on the left of the screen (looks like four squares) and search "Java." Install the extension pack. Then, click the beaker icon representing testing underneath the extensions icon. Enable Java testing and choose the JUnit option at the top of the screen (NOT JUnit Jupiter). JUnit should then be successfully set up.

Building the Software
---------------------
Firstly, obtain Visual Studio Code from Microsoft (or potentially another capable IDE). Once it is installed, open up the group41 folder in VSCode. Press Control+Shift+P and type in "export." Select the option "Java: Export Jar." When VSCode asks where the main method is, click "Main." Then, ensure that all elements are enabled and click OK. The project should be built into an executable program called "group41.jar" in the group41 folder. The executable can be renamed to "Mythicimals" to more accurately match the program's purpose.

Running the Software
--------------------
After building the software with VSCode, open the .jar file labelled "group41" or "Mythicimals" to start the application. If compiled correctly, the main menu featuring a dragon, griffin and a unicorn should appear.

User Guide
----------
When the game is started, the user will be brought to the main menu screen of the game. From there, the user may choose to start a new game with a new pet, or to load an old game, if a pet already exists in the file.

If the player chooses to create a new game by clicking the "New Game" button, they will then be presented with the Pet Selection menu. To choose your pet, first enter in a name for the creature. Afterwards, click the button corresponding to the creature type you want (Griffin, Dragon or Unicorn) and then click "Confirm" to start the game. The user will then be brought to the main game interface.

If the player chooses to load a game by clicking the "Load Game" button, they will be presented with the Load Game menu. To select a save, simply click on the button corresponding to the save file to load the game saved to it.

While playing the game, the player can click several buttons to accomplish different actions in the game. For example, the "Play with Pet" button restores the pet's happiness by a slight amount. If the player clicks the "Store" button, they will be brought to the Store menu, where they can spend their virtual currency on items needed for their pet. If the player clicks on the "Inventory" button, they will be brought to the Inventory menu where they can see the different items that they have in stock to give to their pet.

If the player needs assistance or help with any part of the software, they can find explanations and detailed explanations in the Tutorial. To access the tutorial menu, simply click on the "Help" button in the bottom-right corner of the main menu. From there, choose an option in the selection box in the middle of the screen to get help about a variety of different topics.

To quit the game, navigate to the main menu (using the "Back" buttons, if necessary) and select the "Quit" button. The game should instantly close. All save file data will be preserved.

Parental Controls
-----------------
To access the parental controls of the program, first navigate to the main menu. If you open the program, you will be immediately taken there. Click on the Parental Controls button, which should be just above the Exit button, to go to the Parental Controls menu. To be able to see the administrator settings, you must first enter in the administrator password, then click "Authenticate."

The administrator passkey is: BLDdrW7+ygw#cXFzbV

Without this passkey, the user will not be able to alter any administrator/parental controls.
